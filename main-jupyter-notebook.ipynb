       "      <td>It is August, the month when a new generation of black-legged ticks that transmit Lyme and other diseases are hatching. On forest floors, suburban estates and urban parks, they are looking for their first blood meal. And very often, in the large swaths of North America and Europe where tick-borne disease is on the rise, they are feeding on the ubiquitous white-footed mice and other small mammals notorious for harboring pathogens that sicken humans.\\n\\nBut it doesn’t have to be that way. A new study suggests that the rise in tick-borne disease may be tied to a dearth of traditional mouse predators, whose presence might otherwise send mice scurrying into their burrows. If mice were scarcer, larval ticks, which are always born uninfected, might feed on other mammals and bird species that do not carry germs harmful to humans. Or they could simply fail to find that first meal. Ticks need three meals to reproduce; humans are at risk of contracting diseases only from ticks that have previ...</td>\n",

       "19970     It is August, the month when a new generation of black-legged ticks that transmit Lyme and other diseases are hatching. On forest floors, suburban estates and urban parks, they are looking for their first blood meal. And very often, in the large swaths of North America and Europe where tick-borne disease is on the rise, they are feeding on the ubiquitous white-footed mice and other small mammals notorious for harboring pathogens that sicken humans.\\n\\nBut it doesn’t have to be that way. A new study suggests that the rise in tick-borne disease may be tied to a dearth of traditional mouse predators, whose presence might otherwise send mice scurrying into their burrows. If mice were scarcer, larval ticks, which are always born uninfected, might feed on other mammals and bird species that do not carry germs harmful to humans. Or they could simply fail to find that first meal. Ticks need three meals to reproduce; humans are at risk of contracting diseases only from ticks that have previ...   \n",

She surprised Mr. Snow by granting him a live television interview on Sept. 4.\\n\\nPhoto\\n\\nRichard Roth, a former staff correspondent for CBS News, said of Ms. Shaaban, “I don’t know that she ever made a convincing case for Assad’s policies in any broadcast of mine, but she was swell TV: articulate, indomitable, official and — crucially — English-speaking.”\\n\\nMs. Shaaban, who has a Ph.D. in English literature from the University of Warwick in Britain, is often described as a Syrian government spokeswoman and has presented herself to reporters as, in Mr. Roth’s words, “someone who could pull strings in Syria.”\\n\\nShe had been a liaison for Mr. Rose’s interviews of Mr. Assad in 2006 a...   \n",

''Kafka Goes to the Movies'' focuses mainly on the years 1908 to 1913, including the first of his doomed engagements to Felice Bauer. Kafka, in a literary dry spell and contemplating breaking up with Felice, goes to the movies and contrasts his time in the theater with his emotional state outside it. ''Was at the movies,'' he tells his journal. ''Wept. . . . Boundless entertainment. . . . Am completely empty and meaningless, the electric tram passing by has more living meaning.''

       "0  United Nations (United States) (AFP) - UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon voiced confidence on Friday that Donald Trump will shed the strident rhetoric that propelled him to the White House and engage with the world to confront global crises like climate change. Ban told AFP in an interview that he hopes to meet with the US president-elect in the coming weeks to explain how the United Nations expects the United States to \"continue to work for humanity.\"\\nTrump won the US presidency on a platform that calls for closer ties with Russia, pulling out of the Paris climate deal, shaking up security alliances and questioning US funding of the United Nations.\\n\"This is what he said during the campaign period, on the campaign trail,\" Ban said in the interview at UN headquarters where the Trump victory has shocked world diplomats.\\n\"Now, post-election, when he creates his transition team with experts and people with vision and expertise, I am sure that the United States will continue to play a...   \n",

''Crucial details'' that the article claims have been denied to the hostages' families -- how the state police came to kill the hostages, how official discipline collapsed and where the lie that the inmates murdered the hostages originated -- were presented in detail to a federal jury in Buffalo in 1991-92 as part of Al-Jundi v.

It is listed among substances that need to be treated and disposed, according to the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, or O.P.C.W., a group based in The Hague working with the United Nations to oversee the dismantling of Syria’s arsenal.\\n\\nThe group in November invited bids from companies that could carry out the disposal. Before that bidding invitation was made public, it had not been widely known that Syria had hexamine.
