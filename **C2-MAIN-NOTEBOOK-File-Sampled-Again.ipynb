      "11    Today at the OECD Ministerial Meeting on the Digital Economy in Mexico, the Global Commission on Internet Governance released its final report, One Internet. Despite its important-sounding name, the Commission is not an official body, but a think tank convened in 2014 by the Center for International Governance Innovation (CIGI) and Chatham House, composed of a diverse panel of 29 invited experts from industry, government, academia, and civil society (including EFF Pioneer Award recipient Anriette Esterhuysen).\\n\\nThe Commission had a broad and open mandate to articulate and advance a strategic vision for the future of Internet governance in light of some of its most hotly-disputed global political challenges. Foremost among these challenges are the betrayal of Internet users’ trust by states engaged in mass online surveillance, and moves by authoritarian states to control and restrict the open Internet.

Mr. Dolin is promoting his company’s system as costing only a tenth as much.\\n\\nThe system at m650 has a “key safe” — by which residents can be buzzed in if they misplace their keys — and the one at the Vesta has cold storage (a big refrigerator) in the package room.

Your dashing commuter moved across Park Avenue, along with his bank's headquarters.\\n\\nThe statue, \"Taxi!,\" a popular tourist photo opportunity, is by J. Seward Johnson Jr., the realist sculptor and Johnson & Johnson heir from New Jersey. It was commissioned by Chemical Bank Corporation and it went up in 1983 on the southeast corner of 48th Street and Park Avenue. The slim, middle-aged man, his shirt painted white, briefcase and coat in hand and detailed down to his mustache and tie clip, probably caused cabbies to slam on their brakes when he first made his appearance.\\n\\nThe statue was moved to the northwest corner of Park and 47th Street around 1992, when Chemical merged with Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company, whose headquarters were there...\n",
