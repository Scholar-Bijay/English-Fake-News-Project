       "19970     It is August, the month when a new generation of black-legged ticks that transmit Lyme and other diseases are hatching. On forest floors, suburban estates and urban parks, they are looking for their first blood meal. And very often, in the large swaths of North America and Europe where tick-borne disease is on the rise, they are feeding on the ubiquitous white-footed mice and other small mammals notorious for harboring pathogens that sicken humans.\\n\\nBut it doesn’t have to be that way. A new study suggests that the rise in tick-borne disease may be tied to a dearth of traditional mouse predators, whose presence might otherwise send mice scurrying into their burrows. If mice were scarcer, larval ticks, which are always born uninfected, might feed on other mammals and bird species that do not carry germs harmful to humans. Or they could simply fail to find that first meal. Ticks need three meals to reproduce; humans are at risk of contracting diseases only from ticks that have previ...   \n",

She surprised Mr. Snow by granting him a live television interview on Sept. 4.\\n\\nPhoto\\n\\nRichard Roth, a former staff correspondent for CBS News, said of Ms. Shaaban, “I don’t know that she ever made a convincing case for Assad’s policies in any broadcast of mine, but she was swell TV: articulate, indomitable, official and — crucially — English-speaking.”\\n\\nMs. Shaaban, who has a Ph.D. in English literature from the University of Warwick in Britain, is often described as a Syrian government spokeswoman and has presented herself to reporters as, in Mr. Roth’s words, “someone who could pull strings in Syria.”\\n\\nShe had been a liaison for Mr. Rose’s interviews of Mr. Assad in 2006 a...   \n",

''Kafka Goes to the Movies'' focuses mainly on the years 1908 to 1913, including the first of his doomed engagements to Felice Bauer. Kafka, in a literary dry spell and contemplating breaking up with Felice, goes to the movies and contrasts his time in the theater with his emotional state outside it. ''Was at the movies,'' he tells his journal. ''Wept. . . . Boundless entertainment. . . . Am completely empty and meaningless, the electric tram passing by has more living meaning.''
